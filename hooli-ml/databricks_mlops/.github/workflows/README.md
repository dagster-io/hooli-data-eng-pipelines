# CI/CD Workflow Definitions
This directory contains CI/CD workflow definitions using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions),
under ``workflows``. These workflows cover testing and deployment of both ML code (for model training, batch inference, etc) and 
Databricks ML resource definitions. 

To set up CI/CD for a new project,
please refer to [Setting up CI/CD](<../../README.md#Setting up CI/CD>) and following the [MLOps Setup Guide](../../docs/mlops-setup.md)
to make sure your `WORKFLOW_TOKEN` secret has been properly set up with `Workflow` permissions.
